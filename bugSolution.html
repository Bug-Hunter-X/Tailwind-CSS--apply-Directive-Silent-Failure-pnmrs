The solution involves carefully checking your Tailwind CSS configuration file (`tailwind.config.js` or `tailwind.config.cjs`) and ensuring that all classes used in `@apply` directives are correctly defined.  Using your IDE's auto-completion features can help prevent these issues.  Another good practice is to employ linters, such as `stylelint` with the appropriate Tailwind CSS plugin, to catch such errors during development. 

For example, to fix the previous bug you must make sure `bg-red-500` and `text-white` are included in your `tailwind.config.js` file's `content` array. Or if they are custom classes, add them to your custom classes definitions.

If you are unsure which classes are available in your setup you can use Tailwind's PurgeCSS feature or check the generated CSS file to see the complete list of classes.
